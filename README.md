# Smart-Farming-App
* This is a smart farming app which helps farmers to remotely monitor their crop and take necessary actions.

* It has features called disease detection and crop prediction. 

* Disease detection enables farmers to identify any potential disease plants may have by taking the image of leaves of crops.

* Crop prediction shows the list of the crops that can be planted on his farm by analyzing the surrounding parameters like humidity, temperature, soil moisture, ph level, etc.

* There is a brach called 'api', which has python code for the disease detection which will run on some server and our app try to communicate via a server-client mechanism to the server for getting the result for disease detection.
